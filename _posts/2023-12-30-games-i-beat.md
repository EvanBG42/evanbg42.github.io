Now, in the order I beat them:

# LEGO Builder's Journey (2019) [PC]

This game is an utter delight -- a series of connected Lego dioramas with unique puzzle mechanics that tell a wordless story. The interaction with the game is almost entirely limited to moving around and placing pieces in each scene. However, thanks to some brilliant design and interesting settings, the game gets a lot of mileage out of the minimalist mechanics.

Especially notable is that the game portrays its characters not as the usual "mini-figs" but as even simpler shapes. The combination of wordless story, simple interaction, and abstraction with a small number of Lego pieces makes for a great all-ages game. I did struggle with a few of the puzzles (there's one that I solved twice that I _still_ can't tell what the game wanted), but it's a ton of fun regardless.

Because of the story element and the ability to "cheese" puzzles and solve them in ways that feel a bit like breaking the rules, I imagine there's a lot of influence from the _Portal_ games here.
