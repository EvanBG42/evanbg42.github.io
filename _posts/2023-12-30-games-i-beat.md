TODO: Intro and stuff

Now, in the order I beat them:

# LEGO Builder's Journey (2019) [PC]

This game is an utter delight -- a series of connected Lego dioramas with unique puzzle mechanics that tell a wordless story. The interaction with the game is almost entirely limited to moving around and placing pieces in each scene. However, thanks to some brilliant design and interesting settings, the game gets a lot of mileage out of the minimalist mechanics.

Especially notable is that the game portrays its characters not as the usual "mini-figs" but as even simpler shapes. The combination of wordless story, simple interaction, and abstraction with a small number of Lego pieces makes for a great all-ages game. I did struggle with a few of the puzzles (there's one that I solved twice that I _still_ can't tell what the game wanted), but it's a ton of fun regardless.

Because of the story element and the ability to "cheese" puzzles and solve them in ways that feel a bit like breaking the rules, I imagine there's a lot of influence from the _Portal_ games here.

# Boneworks (2019) [PC]

In my mind, Half-Life: Alyx and Boneworks both occupy a similar space in the pantheon of VR releases. Both are in-depth single-player campaigns with a focus on gunplay and world-building. Where Alyx is painstakingly hyper-polished and accessible, Boneworks opts to go for a detailed physics simulation with a wider variety of guns and all the weirdness and fun that entails.

The biggest thing in Boneworks is that you have a body. Most VR games don't simulate body physics just because of how stomach-churning physical bodies in VR can be. But Boneworks goes all-in. You have a physical body. You have to use continuous movement (the game jokes in its opening about VR teleport-movers being "our forefathers" -- blocky cavemen). The game encourages you to wrestle with "nullbody" enemies and to climb all over parts of the stages. There's no shortage of jankiness that comes out of this decision, but I love the freedom it allows. There's even a warehouse stage that I skipped almost entirely due to being able to climb my way up and over it!

The story in Boneworks is a little obtuse, involving corporate politics, advanced "void" technology, and a literal digital eternal life. But I enjoy that the game is fine letting you piece it together. I even like the FMV elements! That's something I've enjoyed seeing recently (like in Control).

All in all a very solid game for VR vets. I look forward to trying out Bonelab in all its moddable glory.
