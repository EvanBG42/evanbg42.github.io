TODO: Intro and stuff

Now, in the order I beat them:

# LEGO Builder's Journey (2019) [PC]

This game is an utter delight -- a series of connected Lego dioramas with unique puzzle mechanics that tell a wordless story. The interaction with the game is almost entirely limited to moving around and placing pieces in each scene. However, thanks to some brilliant design and interesting settings, the game gets a lot of mileage out of the minimalist mechanics.

Especially notable is that the game portrays its characters not as the usual "mini-figs" but as even simpler shapes. The combination of wordless story, simple interaction, and abstraction with a small number of Lego pieces makes for a great all-ages game. I did struggle with a few of the puzzles (there's one that I solved twice that I _still_ can't tell what the game wanted), but it's a ton of fun regardless.

Because of the story element and the ability to "cheese" puzzles and solve them in ways that feel a bit like breaking the rules, I imagine there's a lot of influence from the _Portal_ games here.

# Boneworks (2019) [PC]

In my mind, Half-Life: Alyx and Boneworks both occupy a similar space in the pantheon of VR releases. Both are in-depth single-player campaigns with a focus on gunplay and world-building. Where Alyx is painstakingly hyper-polished and accessible, Boneworks opts to go for a detailed physics simulation with a wider variety of guns and all the weirdness and fun that entails.

The biggest thing in Boneworks is that you have a body. Most VR games don't simulate body physics just because of how stomach-churning physical bodies in VR can be. But Boneworks goes all-in. You have a physical body. You have to use continuous movement (the game jokes in its opening about VR teleport-movers being "our forefathers" -- blocky cavemen). The game encourages you to wrestle with "nullbody" enemies and to climb all over parts of the stages. There's no shortage of jankiness that comes out of this decision, but I love the freedom it allows. There's even a warehouse stage that I skipped almost entirely due to being able to climb my way up and over it!

The story in Boneworks is a little obtuse, involving corporate politics, advanced "void" technology, and a literal digital eternal life. But I enjoy that the game is fine letting you piece it together. I even like the FMV elements! That's something I've enjoyed seeing recently (like in Control).

All in all a very solid game for VR vets. I look forward to trying out Bonelab in all its moddable glory.

# Bonelab (2022) [PC]
![Bonelab]({% link /assets/images/2023/bonelab.png %}

Bonelab is a weird creature. Part campaign, and part modding foundation. It's easy to see why people were disappointed when it first came out. Boneworks had a pretty lengthy campaign (~10 hrs), but Bonelab's campaign is a scant 4 - 5 hrs at most. I enjoyed Bonelab's campaign, especially with just how weird it got at times, but I was definitely left wanting more.

Bonelab takes the "you have a physics body" to the next level with its avatars system. Each avatar has stats derived from its proportions, and the base game includes a wide variety to play with. My personal favorites are Heavy, who's strong enough to pick up and throw enemies around, and Fast, who is as speedy as she sounds. The names aren't very creative. 

After Boneworks' initial release, it got several large updates with standalone arenas and gameplay additions. These sort of standalone activities are at the core of Bonelab, as opposed to being peripheral to the story. For a game with a major focus on modding, this makes a lot of sense. I've played and enjoyed several mods, including new avatars and areas. Avatars are especially fun, because you can bring in characters from all sorts of games that modders have kindly pulled the 3D models for. And original models too! My favorites are especially large or especially large characters. I've even played the 30+ ft tall Iron Giant, which is a ton of fun despite being real finnicky to control.

I've tried a few mod weapons, but not been able to make them work. I think it might have something to do with my controls not having a button mapped to "activated thing on the held item". Maybe someday I'll get that Airpods shotgun working...

# Alien: Isolation (2014) [PC]

TODO TODO
    - I played on hard accidentally lol
    - The design and look of the space station is incredible. Beautiful chunky 80s tech vibes throughout.
    - Sound design iconic. The healing station beckoning me through walls. The crafting sound! Good companions to the Alien's iconic sound.
    - I appreciate that the Alien is unkillable -- that . But goodness it felt like any time I did anything wrong it was instant death game over. It makes sense but I don't think it's all that fun

# Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap

TODO TODO
    - Audio video treat. Absolutely gorgeous all around. I'm gonna have to buy the OST.
    - Quickly switching between old and new is incredible. The game doesn't skip a beat! I loved checking out the older style while mostly playing the new style.
    - Design wise this game feels pretty modern. I love how the different tranformations have their own gameplay. The mouse character can go all over the place! The lion can hit above and below! The bird can FLY!
    - Gallery is lovely. Delighteful art. And great behind the scenes music recording videos -- good to see working musicians like that.
